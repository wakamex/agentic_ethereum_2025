🥈
2nd place
$4,000
🥉
3rd place
$2,000
We believe the future of on-chain activity will be driven by autonomous agents—some operating purely in code, others bridging into physical or virtual robotics. In this bounty, we challenge you to create something that demonstrates the power of AI interacting with Ethereum in a tangible, next-gen way.
Possible Directions (Not Exhaustive):
- Robotics & Web3: Use ROS, Gazebo (or any robotics stack) plus an AI agent that references on-chain data or executes on-chain actions. For example, a robot that navigates a maze if it receives certain on-chain signals or incentives.
- Metaverse/Virtual Simulations: Integrate a 3D environment (Unity, Blender, etc.) with an AI agent that uses Ethereum smart contracts for logic or governance.
- Supply Chain Automation: Show how robotics (real or simulated) can be orchestrated or compensated via DAOs, token incentives, or L2 microtransactions.
- AI Governance: Build a multi-agent system where AI modules vote on proposals or set parameters on-chain, potentially triggering real-world robotic or IoT actions.
Qualification Requirements

1. Technical Depth – Effective integration of AI frameworks with blockchain and (optionally) robotics or simulation tools.
2. Novelty – Is your approach distinctly innovative? Does it showcase a new angle on AI + blockchain?
3. Practical Potential – Could this idea evolve into a real-world application or open doors to new AI-based dApps?
4. User Experience – Clear documentation, a coherent demo, and well-structured code.
5. Completeness – While we don’t expect a polished product, we value a working proof-of-concept with tangible AI–blockchain interaction.

=== Gaia and Collab.Land ===
Gaia is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise.
It allows individuals and businesses to create AI agents. Each Gaia node provides:
- a web-based chatbot UI
- an OpenAI compatible API
100% of today's AI agents are applications in the OpenAI ecosystem. With our API approach, Gaia is an alternative to OpenAI. Each Gaia node has the ability to be customized with a fine-tuned model supplemented by domain knowledge which eliminates the generic responses many have come to expect. For example, a Gaia node for a financial analyst agent can write SQL code to query SEC 10K filings to respond to user questions.
Similar Gaia nodes are organized into Gaia domains, to provide stable services by load balancing across the nodes. Gaia domains have public-facing URLs and promote agent services to their communities. When a user or an agent app sends an API request to the domain's API endpoint URL, the domain is responsible for directing the request to a node that is ready.

=== Lit Protocol ===
The Lit Agent Wallet lets you manage a wallet onchain. It allows AI agents to securely manage private keys, credit card numbers, passwords, and other secrets—without exposing them to developers or LLMs. It built with Lit Protocol, a decentralized key management and compute network. 
                                                                           
Agent owners or designated 'administrators' (such as individuals or DAOs) can manage the tools that agents can use and set the policies that they must adhere to. These are managed onchain and enforced by Lit Protocol.

=== Warden Agent Kit ===
The Warden Agent Kit provides developers with the tools to create decentralized agents with minimal knowledge of Solidity. It simplifies the process of building agents by allowing the integration of custom business logic through Solidity smart contracts.
The Warden Agent Kit includes ready-to-use Solidity contract templates that automate on-chain transactions based on specific conditions. These templates can also be extended for advanced use cases, including integrating predictive models.
To make it accessible for Web2 developers, the Warden Agent Kit is built with TypeScript, enabling seamless integration with familiar tools and workflows. It supports LangChain integration, allowing developers to leverage LangChain’s extensive suite of tools for building and managing agents. All LangChain tools can be integrated, further expanding the capabilities of agents built with the kit. 
Prizes
💰 Agents with Best DeFi skills ⸺ $2,000
Up to 2 teams will receive $1,000
Participants of this track are expected to build Agents that master the art of ‘coin’ in other words Agents that perform meaningful operations in DeFi. These operations should use the Warden Agent Kit and invoke smart contracts deployed on the Warden chain. 
For example, an Agent built with Warden Agent Kit might deploy a smart contract on the Warden chain which monitors liquidity on different aggregators and automates portfolio rebalancing. Or the agent performs price prediction and then checks for the best swap (with the least slippage) on different protocols like Uniswap, Aave, Curve, etc. (Note: Contracts deployed on Warden can interact with applications deployed on their respective chain.)
Qualification Requirements

1. All Agents must be built using Warden Agent Kit highlighting the use of Warden native capabilities like Keychain, Spaces, and Rules. (Please see warden documentation for further reading.)
2. On-chain activities must be demonstrated by deploying contracts over the Warden chain.
3. Agents must have a sense of purpose. Brownie points for something that is fun or has the potential to become viral, however only ‘fun’ will not be considered.
4. All code must be open-sourced and clear to read with relevant comments.
5. The project should be added to the Warden Agent example repo. (https://github.com/warden-protocol/agent-kit-examples)
6. Participants are expected to attend mandatory check-in with the Warden team on 4th February and 11th February. No exceptions!
🏆 Intelligent Integrations ⸺ $2,000
Up to 2 teams will receive $1,000
Participants of this track are expected to build useful tools which Integrate Warden capabilities with other AI tools / Frameworks / ML models. The result should be a beautiful amalgamation of tools that are unique and have not been deployed before. (Individual components can be “inspired” however the entire toolkit collectively should be unique).
For example, participants could create an AI agent using the Warden Agent Kit to deploy a smart contract on the Warden chain, where smart contract functions are exposed as callable tools. This would result in a toolkit where each smart contract function serves as an accessible tool. Another example is an AI agent deploying a smart contract on the Warden chain to establish a governance structure (DAO) for managing agent interactions.
Qualification Requirements

1. All Agents must be built using Warden Agent Kit highlighting the use of Warden native capabilities like Keychain, Spaces, and Rules. (Please see warden documentation for further reading.)
2. On-chain activities must be demonstrated by deploying contracts over the Warden chain.
3. Agents must have a sense of purpose. Brownie points for something that is fun or has the potential to become viral, however only ‘fun’ will not be considered.
4. All code must be open-sourced and clear to read with relevant comments.
5. The project should be added to the Warden Agent example repo. (https://github.com/warden-protocol/agent-kit-examples)
6. Participants are expected to attend mandatory check-in with the Warden team on 4th February and 11th February. No exceptions!
🤡 Agents & Memes ⸺ $1,000
Participants of this track are expected to build something ‘fun’ (as expected with meme coins) but also useful which adds value to the existing meme economy. 
Participants can either choose to build something exclusive out of the box, or refine some existing tools around meme coins and perfect them to be something more meaningful. 
For example, participants can create AI Agents using the Warden Agent Kit to get a sense of user sentiment over x. This would be translated into some actionable items like triggering the smart contract deployed on the Warden chain to create a new meme coin and deploy it. 
Or the agent might trigger the contract to buy some meme coins based on certain predictions. (Predictions can be mocked for hackathon.
